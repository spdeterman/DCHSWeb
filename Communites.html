            <h1>Apple Valley</h1>
            <p>
                When Orrin Thompson began building houses in Lebanon Township in the 1960s he named the original development “Apple Valley” after a town of the same name in California.
                Lebanon, originally named for an Ohio town, was a quiet agricultural community until the 1960s. When Orrin Thompson began his series of subdivisions, the new residents of the township voted to change the name of the township to Apple Valley.
                By the end of the Twentieth Century, this quiet farming community had been transformed into a bustling city of 45,527 residents.
