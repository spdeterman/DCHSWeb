	<h1>Our History</h1><br>

	<p>In 1939, Fred Lawshe formed the Dakota County Historical Society to preserve, interpret and promote the history of <br>
	Dakota County. To accomplish this mission, Fred teamed with other individuals and groups to begin the process of collecting, <br>
	interpreting and publishing the history of the County. Fred and the other members accumulated over 3,000 primary source <br>
	materials between 1939 and 1971.</p>

	<p>The first meeting of the ‘historically minded’ Dakota County Historical and Archaeological Society was held in the<br>
	South St. Paul Public Library in April 1939. The original purpose of the Society was to “establish a link with the past <br>
	by preserving the relics, written records, and other material of those historic days of long ago for future generations.” </p>

	<h1>Fred E. Lawshe</h1> <br>

	<p>Fred Lawshe was the first president of the Society and he lobbied long and hard to secure space for a museum. <br>
	He was the director and curator of the museum until his death in 1971. What began as a hobby led to a full-time passion, <br>
	especially after he retired in 1958 from his 40 year job as the South St. Paul High School industrial arts teacher. Fred Lawshe <br>
	logged thousands of hours creating exhibits, giving tours to student groups, and organizing collections.</p>

	<h1>The First Museum</h1>

	<p>It wasn’t until 1955 that DCHS opened its first museum. The Society first looked to open a museum in Hastings, <br>
	the county seat, but couldn’t secure a location. Attempts to place a museum in the Faribault House in Mendota also failed. <br>
	When South St. Paul decided to build a new municipal building, the Society asked the city if it could open a museum in the <br>
	new building’s basement. The city agreed. The Society looked for a temporary home for its new museum. Space was found in <br>
	Room 308 in the South St. Paul High School. While DCHS did own some artifacts, many of the original exhibits were built around <br>
	artifacts borrowed from the Minnesota Historical Society.</p>

	<p>One of the advantages of being located in a high school was that student members of Scribes, a junior historian group, <br>
	often served as museum attendants. The growth of the student population led to the closing of the museum in the school only a <br>
	year after it had opened. On April 16, 1957, DCHS officially opened its history museum in one room of the South St. Paul <br>
	municipal building basement. But the one room was quickly filled with new donations and exhibits. By 1961, the museum had <br>
	over 5,000 items. Repeated requests for additional space resulted in an expansion to another room, then another, then across <br>
	the hall until finally, the museum filled the entire basement of the South St. Paul city building.</p>

	<h1>A New Building</h1><br>

	<p>In 1976, the Dakota County government was looking for a bicentennial project, and the Dakota County Historical Society board <br>
	members had just the project – a new museum building. The museum was bursting at the seams in the basement of the city building. <br>
	County commissioners finally agreed to make a permanent history museum building their legacy, but a debate did ensue about the <br>
	building’s architectural design and its location. One was finally agreed upon, and on December 30, 1976, one day before the <br>
	bicentennial year ended, county commissioners and DCHS board members broke the ground for the museum.</p>

	<p>Although Fred Lawshe never got to witness his dream – a museum building – the museum was dedicated to him. <br>
	The storage area still holds numerous original paintings and prints which Fred had created for his exhibits. <br>
	And his distinctive object labels still provide extra information on quite a few “mystery objects”.<p>

	<h1>Today’s Museum</h1><br>

	<p>The Dakota County Historical Society continues to build upon the efforts of Fred E. Lawshe and others who have worked<br>
	for the Society over the years. There are now over 25,000 objects in the museum’s collections and more than 20,000 photographs. <br>
	Its publishing program, first begun in 1951 with a newsletter called Over the Years, now creates over 100 pages of <br>
	original historical research a year. Its research library has one of the best collections of local history in the State.</p>
